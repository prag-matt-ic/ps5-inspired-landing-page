**Mini project inspired by the PS5 loading screen**

[View it live](https://pragmattic-ps5.vercel.app/)

Built with Next.js, Three.js (R3F), TailwindCSS, GSAP, React Transition Group, Floating UI, Zustand, and thi.ng/color.

The shader/GPU logic for the particles is written entirely in Typescript using Three.js Shading Language.
It makes use of the WebGPU API for compute shaders.

I recorded a supporting [Youtube Video](https://youtu.be/EOI-XLDvewQ?si=eAZWDathf1_ohvNp) diving into process.
